New idea: program for Windows and MacOS that gathers a list of all your programs, checks for their alternatives on Linux, and lists them. I considered uploading the data to a server for processing, but I am considering risking the file size and loading it locally, as I don't know how to delete all the gathered app data within 60 seconds/90 seconds. Maybe I am underestimating the computing power of the system? If I go with the server option, all data except for the report will be deleted from the server within a second of the report going out, and if data isn't processed in 60/90/<given_amount_of_time> it will get deleted anyway and throw an error. The concerns I have are windows programs that can be executed, but not installed, as they are extremely difficult to find, and it would be an invasion of privacy to do that. Some notable examples from my experience include Snowcraft, and FNAFWorld.
