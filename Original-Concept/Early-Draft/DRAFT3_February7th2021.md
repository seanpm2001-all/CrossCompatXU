Note: when using an Internet connection, your data will be encrypted and securely sent to our server to be processed. Within 90 seconds of starting the process, all data you sent will be deleted (regardless if it is done or not) except for the report, which will be deleted when you close the page/reload the tab. The report is stored on your computer and not our servers. Once you get the results, all data you sent us will have been completely deleted from our servers. If you use the program offline, you will be able to access the report under C://Users/<username>/Documents (Windows) home/users/<username>/Documents (UNIX-like, Linux, MacOS)

You need at least 100 kilobytes (100,000 bytes) of free space to use this program. This is not a problem for modern computers, as any computer from the year 2009 and up has at least 2 gigabytes (2,000,000,000 bytes) of memory.

Your computer currently has <{}> bytes of free space.
